# 3 source of data used by collector - different execution layers

## get_transaction(tx_hash)

### What it represents

Intent / payload — what the sender asked the network to do

### Data source

Stored in the block’s transaction list (or mempool if pending)

### Contains

- from
- to
- value
- input (calldata)
- gas, gasPrice / maxFeePerGas / maxPriorityFeePerGas
- nonce
- v, r, s (signature)
- blockHash, blockNumber (null if pending)

### Does NOT contain

- Execution result
- Status (success/failure)
- Logs/events
- Gas actually used

### Use case

“What did this transaction try to do?”

## get_transaction_receipt(tx_hash)

### What it represents

Execution result — what actually happened on-chain

### Data source

Generated by the EVM during block execution and stored with the block

### Contains

- status (1 = success, 0 = revert)
- gasUsed, cumulativeGasUsed
- contractAddress (if contract creation)
- logs (all emitted events)
- logsBloom
- blockHash, blockNumber
- transactionIndex
- effectiveGasPrice

### Does NOT contain

- Original calldata details like decoded function args
- Signature fields
- Nonce

### Use case

“Did it succeed, how much gas did it use, and what events did it emit?”

## get_logs(filter)

### What it represents

Indexed event view — logs across blocks, not tied to a specific transaction

### Data source

Node’s block-level log index, prefiltered using logsBloom

### Contains (per log entry)

- address (emitting contract)
- topics[] (indexed event fields + event signature)
- data (non-indexed event fields)
- blockNumber
- transactionHash
- transactionIndex
- logIndex

### Does NOT contain

- Transaction metadata (gas, sender, calldata)
- Receipt fields like status or gasUsed

### Use case

“Find all events matching these filters across many blocks.”
