`Calldata (Input)`

is the immutable, read-only byte array included in an Ethereum transaction that specifies the function to be called on a smart contract and the arguments passed to it. It is ABI-encoded and made available to the EVM during execution, but it is not stored in contract storage and cannot be modified by the contract.
